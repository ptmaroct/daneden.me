Daniel Eden is a Designer with a penchant for the web, typography, and
interaction design. He prefers to refer to himself in the first person.

I'm currently living and working in San Francisco as a Product Designer for
[Facebook](https://facebook.com). Previously, I worked as a Designer and
Engineer for [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com).

I spend my time [Tweeting](http://twitter.com/_dte "@_dte on Twitter"),
taking [photographs](https://photos.daneden.me/ "Daniel's Photography"),
and [writing code](https://github.com/daneden "daneden on GitHub").

I'm currently unavailable for work, but you can take a look at
[my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf
"Daniel Eden’s résumé") anyway.
